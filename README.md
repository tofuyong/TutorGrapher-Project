## About The Project
<p>
  Managing the progress and grades of multiple students from different schools, each with its own assessment format, presents a significant challenge for free-lance tutors who do not have tools at their disposal for maintaining academic documentation. Parents who pay a premium for tutoring services expect personalised feedback that reflects their child's progress and performance.
</p>
<p>
  This is where TutorGrapher comes in as a productivity tool designed for free-lance tutors. With TutorGrapher, tutors can easily keep track of their students' details and grades. The charting functionality enables tutors to effortlessly create charts that visually depict students' academic progress over time. Additionally, the report card generation feature allows tutors to integrate charts and feedback into report cards for sharing with parents. This makes monitoring student progress and providing feedback a breeze for tutors.
